# About the project
I replicated the results from the classic paper by Grebogi, Ott e Yorke (available at: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.238.4827.632). Os resultados obtidos s√£o apresentados no arquivo ipynb.

# Results (in Portuguese)
The results are in the exame.ipynb file. Although it is in Portuguese, you can view the beautiful fractals and other interesting graphs.
